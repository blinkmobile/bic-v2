## Purpose

This project is the front-end component for our mobility platform. As such, the material here may be of limited use outside of our platform.

Opening this code serves primarily to encourage understanding and discussion.

An effort is underway to replace this project with a greater focus on maintainability and extensibility.

## Version Numbers

This project is NOT versioned according to Semantic Versioning. Rather, it is versioned according to our [Shifted Semantic Versioning](https://github.com/blinkmobile/docs/wiki/Process:-Semantic-Versioning#shifted-semantic-versioning).

## History

This is a very old (and formally private) project, with roots traced back to 2009. The code base was originally built using Apple's [Dashcode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcode) environment. The Apple-specific code was later exchanged for [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to better support Android devices.

Whilst modern functionality is being delivered in a production capacity by this code, the design of the code itself is understandably a little less modern. Bear in mind that we've learned many lessons over the lifetime of this project, and plan to do things differently with its replacement.
